# CECS 327 S01 - Assignment 8: Build an End-to-End IoT System

# Leila Nunez and Huy Ngo - Group 24

## Overview
This project is an end-to-end IoT system integrating a TCP client/server, a database, and IoT sensor data to process user queries. Metadata for IoT devices is used to enhance functionality. The system performs calculations and unit conversions and delivers results in response to user queries.

## Objectives
By completing this project, we achieved the following:
1. Integrated IoT sensors and databases into a functional system.
2. Improved TCP client-server communication using real-world IoT data.
3. Utilized metadata for IoT devices to enhance system flexibility.
4. Performed data analysis and unit conversions for user queries.
5. Gained experience with cloud deployment and system integration.

## System Requirements
- **TCP Client and Server**: Modified versions from Assignment 6.
- **Database**: Includes IoT sensor data and metadata from Assignment 7.
- **IoT Sensors**: Simulated sensor data with device metadata from `dataniz.com`.
- **Development Environment**:
  - Python or other programming languages (based on previous assignments).
  - GitHub for version control and code sharing.
  - Cloud deployment platform (if applicable).

  ## Running Files
To run the client, server, and database, simply enter the following into command prompt sessions (2):
1. python3 /path/to/echoServer.py
2. python3 /path/to/echoClient.py
